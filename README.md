## Data Description
Our data set was obtained from [catalog.data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crash-reporting-drivers-data) and contains data about motor vehicle operators involved in traffic accidents on county and local roadways in Montgomery County, Maryland. The columns in the data set contain information about the accident's case number, what kind of accident it was, where it occured, nearby weather and road conditions at the time of the crash, any injuries involved, and details about the cars involved in the crash, and each row represents a unique case.
## 2 Questions and their Importance
### Questions 1
*Does drunk driving or unsafe weather conditions lead to more car accidents, and how do these factors affect accident severity?*

By utilizing data collected about weather conditions and accident severity, civil engineers are better able to design roads with high visibility and are better suited for adverse weather conditions. Also, lawmakers and police forces can use data concerning driver intoxication and accident severity to better understand and cut down on drunk driving accidents. Both of these questions are incredibly important, aimed at reducing car accidents and making our roads safer.
### Question 2
*At what time of day do the highest number of crashes occur?*

By utilizing data/time data with crash volume, police forces are better able to staff appropriately to respond to accidents quickly and get emergency personnel on the scene faster, which is crucial for saving lives in violent accidents. Also, this data can then be used to ask some more causational questions, like why does *this* specific time of day have the highest volume of accidents.
## Data Manipulation
No manipulation was applied to the dataset.
